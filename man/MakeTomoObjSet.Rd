\title{Make set of tomoseq objects}
\usage{
MakeTomoObjSet(x, y, z, mask)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.frame object containing a simulated Tomo-seq data
for x-axis sections. The rows represent genes. The first column
contains gene IDs and the second and subsequent columns contain
gene expression levels in sections.}

\item{y}{A data.frame object containing a simulated Tomo-seq data for y-axis
sections. The rows represent genes. The first column contains gene IDs and
the second and subsequent columns contain gene expression levels in sections.}

\item{z}{A data.frame object containing a simulated Tomo-seq data for
z-axis sections. The rows represent genes. The first column
contains gene IDs and the second and subsequent columns contain
gene expression levels in sections.}

\item{mask}{A 3D array that represents if each boxel is included to sample.
You can make a mask using \code{masker}.}
